This project uses javascript with jquery to access Giphy with its API. 

Click on a button to retrieve 10 images from Giphy using the key words on the button. You can also make your own button using the text box in the top right corner. 

You can toggle each image between an animated and a still state by clicking on it.

Have fun!
